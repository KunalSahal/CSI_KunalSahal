## About This Project

Hello! I'm excited to share my first Streamlit application. As a data science intern, I wanted to create something that demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflows in an interactive web interface. This project helped me learn how to deploy ML models and make them accessible to non-technical users.

## What This App Does

This dashboard allows users to:
- Train ML models on different datasets with various algorithms
- Make real-time predictions with interactive input controls
- Compare model performance side-by-side
- Explore data insights through interactive visualizations
- Understand model behavior through feature importance and probabilities


## Datasets & Models

### Datasets Available:
- Iris Dataset - Classic flower classification (150 samples, 4 features)
- Wine Dataset - Wine quality classification (178 samples, 13 features)
- California Housing - House price prediction (20,640 samples, 8 features)

### Algorithms Implemented:
- Classification: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM
- Regression: Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVR

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- ML Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Processing: StandardScaler for feature scaling
- Model Persistence: Session state management
